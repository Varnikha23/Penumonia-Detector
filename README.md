# Pneumonia Detection using Deep Learning

This Flask web application allows users to upload chest X-ray images and uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to detect pneumonia. The system processes the image and predicts whether the patient is likely to have pneumonia or not.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- **Framework**: Flask
- **Model**: TensorFlow / Keras pre-trained CNN
- **Input**: Chest X-ray image (JPG/PNG)
- **Output**: Prediction (Pneumonia / Normal)
